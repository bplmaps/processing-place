  <h5>Dedication</h5>
  <i>Processing Place</i> is dedicated to the memory of David J. Weaver (1951-2024), whose career ran through the history of cartography and digital mapping in Massachusetts. Weaver’s collections, including many of his own maps, form a key part of the Leventhal Center’s holdings in contemporary cartography. His enthusiasm, knowledge, and friendship were indispensable in the curation of this exhibition. Explore Weaver's collections, many of which are displayed in <i>Processing Place</i>, at the links below:
