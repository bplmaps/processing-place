**This excerpt from a booklet on Canada’s land management tools provides a retrospective on the development of the Canada Land Inventory, including remarks on the use of GIS to complete it**. This is frequently cited as the world’s first GIS, and for good reason: major aspects of our contemporary geospatial vocabulary, such as organizing features into **points, lines, and polygons**, originated with Canada GIS.
