**One of the most famous maps in the Leventhal Centerâ€™s collections, this whale chart was created by Lt. Matthew Fontaine Maury in 1851 to show the distribution of different whale species and the best seasons for hunting them**. Though more than 130 years apart, both this map and Resources on Georges Bank and Nantucket Shoals rely on the convention of a systematic grid and a combination of color and pictorial symbols to create a simple way of **encoding** geographic observations.

Eventually, subdividing geographic areas into zones on a continuous grid developed from a cartographic convention into a technical one. Today, continuous grids are commonly used for encoding **geospatial** information as **raster** data. In raster data, geographic information is stored as an array of regularly sized **pixels**, each containing measurements of some values (for example, number of whales). Raster data is described in greater detail in the section on <span class="crosslink">Pixelating Places"</span>.
