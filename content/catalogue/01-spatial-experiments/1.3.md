Much like the Computer Atlas of Kenya, this atlas of "Bangla Desh" consists of choropleth maps produced by line printer. The "scan-line procedure," as it was called in the 1970s, printed maps one line at a time (similar to a typewriter):

> "THE SCAN-LINE PROCEDURE MAKES POSSIBLE THE USE OF SMALL COMPUTERSâ€¦ STORAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE REDUCED BY HAVING ONLY ONE PRINT LINE OF THE MAP IN MEMORY AT ANYTIME. WHEN THE LINE IS PRINTED, THAT PORTION OF CORE STORAGE IS THEN AVAILABLE FOR THE NEXT PRINT LINE OF THE MAP. THEREFORE THE SIZE OF THE MAP IS NOT RESTRICTED BY THE MEMORY REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROGRAM AND RUNNING TIME ON THE COMPUTER IS THE ONLY CONSIDERATION."

In making the atlas, the authors had a dual goal: to "present some of the spatial patterns...of this new nation," as well as "examine the potential of computer maps" in displaying such data. Thus, the applications of computer mapping in newly independent nations like Kenya and Bangladesh was not just a coincidence; as D.R.F. Taylor wrote in his Computer Atlas of Kenya, computer mapping was exciting in these places precisely because it had "not been applied in developing nations."
