When this atlas was first published in March of 1972, it primarily depicted data from 1951 and 1961 censuses of East Pakistan. However, on March 25, West Pakistan (now Pakistan) launched a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Bangladeshi Bengalis. A revised edition of the atlas---printed that July using SYMAP---included data from humanitarian nutritional surveys conducted that June, depicting variables such as damage to housing status. Because computer maps could be made and printed relatively quickly, they were useful for communicating information in rapidly changing situations like this.
