<span class="body-large">For a long time, geographers and scientists have gathered information from afar, relying on technologies like telescopes or balloon photography. How did the rise of computer-aided cartography change this process of remote sensing?</span>

Remote sensing was practiced as early as the 1850s, when hobbyists and photographers affixed cameras to balloons and kites and sent them into the air to capture so-called "bird’s eye views." These methods could reveal cities, even whole regions, in a single image---but our bird’s eye views got even sharper in the mid-twentieth century, when launching satellites into the earth’s orbit allowed us to observe landscapes from a much more remote perspective.
