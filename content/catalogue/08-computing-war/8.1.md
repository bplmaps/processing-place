**In 1974, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory made an early attempt at automatically creating geospatial data when it published MAPEDIT, a software that could read map images and automatically digitize polygons from them**. The 1977 workbook for the MAPEDIT **software** shown here includes a printed list of commands that users could execute by typing into a computer terminal. One such command---HBOMB, which "Obliterates all island points in all map items on the **geocode** list"---serves as a reminder of how software systems can borrow from, and reproduce aspects of, real-world geographical conflicts.
