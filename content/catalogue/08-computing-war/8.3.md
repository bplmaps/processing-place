**This map shows the island of Nomans Land (likely named for the Wampanoag sachem Tequenoman), which sits just off the southwestern coast of Martha’s Vineyard.** Created for the Army Corps of Engineers as part of a project to identify high-risk areas for coastal erosion, the map depicts average annual erosion rates as tick marks along the island’s coast. What it doesn’t show are the bombs: between 1942 and 1996, the island was exclusively used by the U.S. Navy as a practice bombing range. Due to the safety risks of unexploded ordnance, Nomans Land is closed for all public use today. Somewhat paradoxically, this solitude makes it an excellent refuge for migratory birds.
