**Geospatial tools like the buffer, commonly used in environmental modeling, made it easier for mapmakers to analyze geographic features in close proximity to one another**. This 1988 map from the geographer William Bunge applies **buffer** zones for a more overtly political message about nuclear fallout. Bright red circles indicate “Zones of destruction” after a simulated nuclear attack of major cities in New England.

Buffer zones are often intermediary steps in a longer **geospatial** analysis; sometimes, the buffers that a mapmaker created during their analysis don’t even need to be included in the final map product. In this map, however, the buffers are precisely the point: as Bunge writes in the caption, they give the earth’s surface the appearance of “what is left of a piece of flattened dough after being cut up by a cookie cutter.”
