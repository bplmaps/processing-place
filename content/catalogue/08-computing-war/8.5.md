**While these aerial photos of the Enewatok Atoll in the Marshall Islands are not, strictly speaking, "computer maps," they do document some of the haunting consequences of geographical computation**. The detonation of the first hydrogen bomb in 1952 (codenamed "Operation Ivy") changed the course of history, leaving an irrevocable mark on the earth in the process. Taken by the U.S. Air Force before and after detonating the hydrogen bomb "Ivy Mike," these photos capture the total evisceration of the island of Elugelab.
