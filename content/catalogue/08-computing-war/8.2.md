**The first fully digital computer---the ENIAC, pictured here---was originally developed by the U.S. Army to compute ballistic firing tables in World War II.** The accurate collection and computation of geospatial data, including parameters like wind speed and height of target above sea level, would prove integral to processing calculations needed to strike a faraway target.

Data was collected with manual tools like weather balloons before being entered to the ENIAC via **<a class="gloss" target="blank" href="../../../glossary/">punched cards</a>** (including **<a class="gloss" target="blank" href="../../../glossary/">FORTRAN</a>**). Roughly 125 hours of computing time later, according to scientists at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering where ENIAC was housed, one could expect a "reasonably complete table for the determination of the drag on an ordinary shaped projectile head moving at supersonic speeds."
