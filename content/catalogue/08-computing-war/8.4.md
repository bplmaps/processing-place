**Geographic data has always played a role in national defense**. In the wake of 9/11---and especially after the passage of the 2002 Homeland Security Act---digital geographic datasets became even more important for assessing and visualizing the needs of the security state. Using building parcel and height data, this map by Massachusetts-based company Applied Geographics uses **geographic information systems** (GIS) to characterize places in Boston that may be at high-risk for similar attacks.
