**Also from the same 1970 U.S. Census atlas, the map in this poster shows data about people living in Boston who are under the age of 18.** The 1970 Census was the first to make extensive use of early electronic computers to process and map the collected data. Read through the poster to learn more about **<a class="gloss" href="../../../glossary/">census tracts</a>** and how they were changing in the 1970s.
