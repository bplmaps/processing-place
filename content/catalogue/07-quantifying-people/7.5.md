**This video depicts a land called "Hexagonia," an imaginary country whose urban areas are shaped in perfectly tesselated hexagons.** In 1969, Geoffrey Dutton---then a student in Harvard's Graduate School of Design and research assistant at the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis---created this display as a visual representation of [central place theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_place_theory). Hexagonia consists of lamps in small glass tubes, spaced about 1.5 inches apart in a triangular grid, which blink out nearly 400 distinct configurations every second. As Matthew Wilson writes in his book *[New Lines](https://www.upress.umn.edu/9780816698530/new-lines/)*:

> [Hexagonia] attempts to adjust our vision to the regularity of human life, order amid chaos. While the film of this work was created in 2015, the original hjardware explored the beauty of the science of place.
