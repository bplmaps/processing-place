<span class="body-large">In computer mapping, the cartographic convention of "layering" is an essential metaphor---but how did this practice work before computers, and how did it change when we started turning layers into digital data?</span>

"Layering" data---that is, creating multiple maps, placing them on top of one another, and then making analytic conclusions based on how they overlap---long predates computer cartography. Some of the earliest data layering techniques were pioneered by landscape architects and regional planners who needed to compare different **<a class="gloss" target="blank" href="../../glossary/">variables</a>**, like population density and land use, in the same area. The arrival of the computer into cartography introduced significant changes into how mapmakers conceptualized layers. As a group of geographers and cartographers wrote in 1976:

> The computer data file process encodes and provides separable access to each subvariable. Thus, in effect, one makes not one data map, but a separable, mappable file component for each subvariable. The computer allows the selective recall and recoding of these subvariables, as required by the criteria in any particular analysis.
