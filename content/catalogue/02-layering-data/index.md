<span class="body-large">In computer mapping, the cartographic convention of "layering" is an essential metaphor---but how did this practice work before computers, and how did it change when we started turning layers into digital data?</span>

"Layering" data---that is, creating multiple maps, placing them on top of one another, and then making analytic conclusions based on how they overlap---long predates computer cartography. Some of the earliest data layering techniques were pioneered by landscape architects and regional planners who needed to compare different **variables**, like population density and land use, in the same area. The arrival of the computer into cartography introduced significant changes into how mapmakers conceptualized layers. As a group of geographers and cartographers wrote in 1976:

> THE COMPUTER DATA FILE PROCESS ENCODES AND PROVIDES SEPARABLE ACCESS TO EACH SUBVARIABLE. THUS, IN EFFECT, ONE MAKES NOT ONE DATA MAP, BUT A SEPARABLE, MAPPABLE FILE COMPONENT FOR EACH SUBVARIABLE. THE COMPUTER ALLOWS THE SELECTIVE RECALL AND RECODING OF THESE SUBVARIABLES, AS REQUIRED BY THE CRITERIA IN ANY PARTICULAR ANALYSIS.
