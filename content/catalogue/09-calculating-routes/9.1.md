**Urban planners, and transportation planners in particular, have tested all sorts of techniques for modeling how people move through cities.** These maps of greater Chicago, with their starbursts of white lines etched against a dark background, exemplify how early computer cartography was seen as a promising technique for processing this kind of data. The maps trace "desire lines"---defined in the study as "the shortest line between origin and destination"---among origin and destination points for three different modes of transportation: the subway-elevated rapid transit system (Figure 18), public buses (Figure 20), and automobiles (Figure 22). Acknowledging that "the desire line is, of course, unrealistic," the studyâ€™s authors insisted that it remained a "simple and completely unbiased presentation" of the location and magnitude of travel in Chicago. Because these maps would go on to inform urban planning decisions, the desire lines are models of the future just as much as they are maps of the present.

THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY PROCESS LOTS OF DATA---AND TO DO SO WITH THE OSTENSIBLY "UNBIASED" AID OF A COMPUTER---WAS A POWERFUL ALLURE OF COMPUTER MAPPING. BUT TO WHAT EXTENT IS COMPUTER MAPPING ACTUALLY "UNBIASED?" WHERE DO YOU THINK DIFFERENT KINDS OF BIASES COULD SNEAK INTO THE COMPUTER MAPPING PROCESS? IS THERE EVER SUCH THING AS AN OBJECTIVE, "UNBIASED PRESENTATION?"
