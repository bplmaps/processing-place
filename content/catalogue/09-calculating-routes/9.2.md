**The machine displayed here---the "Cartographatron"---processed and printed the Transportation Study’s desire line maps**. It processed a staggering dataset of over 10 million "person trips" that were manually gathered and recorded through more than 58,000 surveys and interviews; stored on approximately 378,000 **punched cards**; and eventually, transferred to nineteen reels of magnetic tape. This included each trip’s 22 attributes, such as length, purpose, time of arrival, land use, zone of origin, direction, mode of travel, and more.

Origins and destinations for each trip were geographically associated with sections of a quarter square mile grid overlaid on the study region. Then, the Cartographatron read the magnetic tape, translated the numerical values stored on it into voltages, and used those voltages to generate a spot of light that moved across the face of a cathode ray tube. The path of the "blip," as the study authors called it, was recorded on a photographic plate, with "the weight of each line being directly related to the speed of the moving blip."
