**In the early days of computer cartography, translating information into languages that a computer could understand typically required punching physical holes into punched cards**:

{% figure 'punched-card' %}

Cartographers used coding pads like the blue-green and white one shown to the left to draft their code, often in a language called **FORTRAN**, which was short for "Formula Translation." After handwriting their code on the numbered columns of these pads, cartographers would have someone else transfer it into individual **punched cards** like the one above---a labor-intensive job, given that a single project could yield hundreds of thousands of punched cards. For example, the Chicago Area Transportation Study referenced in the section on <a class="crosslink" href="../../09-calculating-routes/">Calculating Routes"</a> required 378,000 punched cards.
