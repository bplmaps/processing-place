In the late twentieth century, cartographers, architects, and engineers commonly used digitizing pucks like the one shown to the right to create geospatial data. Holding the digitizing puck much like a computer mouse, the operator would create points by tracing the puck across map features and pressing the numbered buttons to mark specific points as they passed through the puckâ€™s crosshairs. Geographic information systems (GIS) software could then interpret and display this information as points, lines, and polygons in a computer map. The photograph below shows the process of how someone would use a digitizing puck when tracing an existing map or aerial image.
