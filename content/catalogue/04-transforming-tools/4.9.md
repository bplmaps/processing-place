**In the 1980s and 1990s, as electrostatic plotters became more affordable, many cartographers used them for map production**. The color shadeset---or list of color combinations and line patterns---shown here was printed as a reference for **<a class="gloss" target="blank" href="../../../glossary/">electrostatic plotter</a>** color options. Cartographers consulted this shadeset list when making design choices about how to visualize different features on a map. The codes next to each swatch uniquely identified each color, allowing members on a large team to communicate color selection with one another---sometimes, as seen on the printout above, through the simple act of marking up the reference sheet with a pen or pencil.
