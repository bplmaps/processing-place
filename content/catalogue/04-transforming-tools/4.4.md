**The advent of aerial photography in the early twentieth century brought with it large-scale surveying of landforms and land use**. To capture aerial photographs, photographers first affixed special cameras to the bottom of in-flight aircrafts. The photographs they took were then developed and aligned to one another, creating an overlapping grid or **<a class="gloss" target="blank" href="../../../glossary/">index mosaic</a>** that covered the entire surveyed area (as shown in *Figure 141*). Mapmakers traced over these "base layers" to create the geographic features, like rivers and mountains, that would eventually appear in other cartographic materials including U.S. Geographical Survey topographic sheets.
