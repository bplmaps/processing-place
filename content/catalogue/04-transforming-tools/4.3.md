**In this site plan, created by the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) in 1968, color becomes political**. Between the late 1950s and early 1970s, the BRA made hundreds of these **urban renewal** maps for various redevelopment projects in Boston. These projects were often fraught, as they tended to target lower-income and nonwhite neighborhoods, displacing the people who lived in them. With the right colors, however, urban renewal could look more welcoming---and the company that sold scribe films to the BRA understood this point. In the promotional booklet shown below, the drafting company Keuffel & Esser write, "The point is, a multi-color map---imaginatively conceived and skillfully produced---gains a graphic impact important to the selling function. It moves beyond the simple purpose of orientation and becomes a marketing tool." In this case, the methods of map production can be directly traced to transformative (and even destructive) urban policies.
