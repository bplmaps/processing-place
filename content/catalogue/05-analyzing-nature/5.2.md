**Also produced in the late 1980s, these maps of Auburn and Millbury depict a buffer workflow that evaluates potential contamination in areas surrounding water wellheads**. In this case, the **geographic information systems** (GIS) analysts took two kinds of features as an input: first, public water supply wells, and second, surface water bodies, like Eddy Pond. The resulting "Zone II" **buffers** represent a protective radius that restricts certain human activities, such as the above-ground storage of hazardous material, that could adversely affect the public water supply.

Around this time, people started writing computer **software** that helped match textual descriptions of addresses to their real-world geographic locations. In the top-right hand corner of this map of Auburn, the authors describe their process for "address matching" underground storage tanks. The two address matching programs they used---one from the U.S. Census' TIGER, and the other from Etak, a company whose innovative navigation system is featured in the section on <a class="crosslink" href="../../09-calculating-routes/">Calculating Routes"</a>---would compare the address associated with each storage tank and try to find a match inside a larger database of street addresses. Today, address matching is more commonly known as **geocoding** and it happens behind the scenes every time you search for an address on your favorite map app.
