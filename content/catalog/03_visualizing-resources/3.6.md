The land use data in the maps of Nantucket featured here were derived from aerial photographs like this one. However, in this photo of Nantucket’s Memorial Airport, the colors are not what they seem. Deep, bright reds surrounding the airport facilities indicate vigorously growing vegetation, while dark, brownish greens near the central harbor suggest wetlands. Often known as “false color” photography, color-infrared images like this one usefully highlight features of the natural landscape.
