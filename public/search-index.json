[{"content":"<p>Today, the maps that show up most often in our everyday lives are made by computers. Even the simplest of these rely on vast databases of geographic information and complex systems for creating and analyzing it. In this exhibition, we look at how computers and cartography fused together over the past century—and how they redrew our world in the process.</p>\n<p>From surveying Boston’s shoreline to counting whales in the Atlantic Ocean, cartographers have always “processed” places. However, around the 1960s, they started using what we now recognize as modern computers to make maps. This changed the scope of what kinds of spatial questions cartographers—and eventually, anyone with a smartphone—could ask about the world around them.</p>\n<p>In <em>Processing Place</em>, we invite you to explore how computer-assisted mapmaking processes helped us combine maps with spatial data, perform calculations, and tell geographic stories from them. These maps, and the techniques employed to make them, built upon centuries of earlier forms of processing. Processing hasn’t always been done by computers, but it <em>has</em> always involved particular people, in particular places, who observed, translated, and visualized the world in efforts to better understand it.</p>\n<p>As you wander through <em>Processing Place</em>, we encourage you to consider “processing” in a holistic, historical sense: that is, not only in terms of digital computation, but as one part of a vibrant and ever-changing <em>cartographic process</em>. Making observations, turning those observations into ideas, and using those ideas to make arguments suited to our individual or collective goals is an essential human activity. By abstracting so much of our spatial thinking and analysis into the memory of hard drives and cloud servers, it’s easy to imagine that computers have somehow made mapmaking less human, when precisely the opposite is true.</p>\n<h3>Exhibition Opens September 13, 2024</h3>\n<p><em>Processing Place</em> opens to the public at the Leventhal Map &amp; Education Center at the Boston Public Library on September 13, 2024.
